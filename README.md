# Hypermedia Applications
## Politecnico di Milano  2019-2020
During the course Hypermedia Applications (Web and Multimedia) 2019-2020 at Politecnico di Milano I have learned how to design and develop a dynamic website.

The website is available at:
http://youthspeakshawaii.herokuapp.com/

The website has been designed following the IDM model principles.
Below the P-IDM structure of the website.
